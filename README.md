# 🧠 Charlie Munger Quote Generator

Charlie Munger’s thinking has deeply influenced my career and worldview. I wanted to create something simple, elegant, and public.

This project was built to practice basic front-end skills (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and learn the end-to-end process of building and deploying a live site.

## 🌐 Live Site

👉 [charliemunger.io](https://www.charliemunger.io)

## 📂 GitHub Repo

👉 [doowmot/charlie-munger-quote-generator](https://github.com/doowmot/charlie-munger-quote-generator)

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- Deployed via GitHub Pages

## 🚀 Features

- Random quote generator
- Clean, minimal design
- Fully static front-end — no frameworks

## 🧩 Potential Features

These are some ideas I’d love to explore if I build on the project further:

- **Quote filtering by category** (e.g. investing, life wisdom, mental models)
- **Keyword search** (e.g. find quotes containing “family”)
- **Social sharing** (e.g. Twitter, email, copy to clipboard)
- **"Chat with Charlie"** — build a simple chatbot interface using a custom-trained GPT on Munger content
- **Daily quote email signup** or homepage widget
